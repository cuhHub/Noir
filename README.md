## üìö Overview
Noir is a framework for Stormworks: Build and Rescue designed to (metaphorically!) hold your hand in some areas with addon development, while also giving you a neat way of organizing your addon.

Helpful examples can be found in [`/examples`](/examples).

## üçó Code Snippet
The below snippet showcases Noir's events system as well as the OOP nature of the framework. The code below simply sends a notification to any player who joins and gives them an item.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building Noir
To build Noir (tool executables and the bundled Noir `.lua` file), see below.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed (may work on earlier 3.x versions, only tested with 3.13).
- Ensure your working directory is the folder containing this README (root).

### Steps
1) Create a virtual environment (venv) by running `py -m venv venv` (you may need to use `pip install venv` if the command doesn't work).
2) Activate the venv using `venv\scripts\activate.bat` (Linux/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`). Use `deactivate` instead of `activate` to exit the venv at any time.
3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary Python packages.
4) With the venv activated and necessary packages installed, simply run `build.bat`. This will bundle Noir into one `.lua` file and build all tools in `/tools` into executables by running `py main.py`. The API reference will also get updated (`py build-api-reference.py`). All of the files are then placed into `_build` while the API reference docs will simply be updated in the `docs` folder.

### Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è | If `py` in the commands above doesn't work, try `python` or `python3` instead.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è | `build.bat` is Windows only. You may need to create your own file that does the same and is compatible with your OS if you're not on Windows.
