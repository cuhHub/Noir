## 📚 Overview
Noir is a framework for Stormworks: Build and Rescue designed to (metaphorically!) hold your hand in some areas with addon development, while also giving you a neat way of organizing your addon.

Noir contains built-in libraries that provide helpful functions to use throughout your code. They can be found in `Noir.Libraries`.

Noir also contains built-in services which can be found in `Noir.Services` or fetched directly via `Noir.Services:GetService(name)`.

Finally, examples can be found in the `examples` directory. You can see a quick example below however.
