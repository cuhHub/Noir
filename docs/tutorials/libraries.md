# ðŸ“– Libraries

## What Are Libraries?

Libraries are simply tables containing helper functions that perform similar actions. These functions can then be used throughout your addon. Libraries are a really good way to organize your code.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Libraries should not interact with services nor the game itself! Libraries can interact with each other though.

If your library needs to interact with the game or with services, you may want to consider making your library a service instead. See [this page](services.md).
{% endhint %}

## Built-In Libraries

Just like with services, Noir comes with built-in libraries. They can be found under `Noir.Libraries`.

A notable library is `Noir.Libraries.Events`.

### Events

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
local sayHello = Noir.Libraries.Events:Create()

sayHello:Connect(function(name)
    print("Hello, "..name)
end)

sayHello:Once(function(name) -- Only ever gets triggered once
    print("Hello and bye forever, "..name)
end)

for _ = 1, 5 do
    sayHello:Fire("Cuh4")
end

--[[
    terminal:
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello and bye forever, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
]]

-- You can also disconnect a connection (function binded to an event) from an event
local connection = sayHello:Connect(function()
    -- Code
end)

connection:Disconnect()

-- Or even manually trigger the connection
connection:Fire()
```
{% endcode %}

## Creating A Library

Unlike services-ish, libraries are very simple to setup. Libraries are also fully intellisense supported as long as you add a simple `---@class` annotation.

First, give your library a name. For this example, we'll call your library `Matrix`, and we'll have the library provide helper methods relating to SW matrices.

Define the library like so:

<pre class="language-lua" data-title="Matrix.lua" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-lua"><strong>---@class MatrixLibrary: NoirLibrary
</strong><strong>MatrixLibrary = Noir.Libraries:Create("Matrix")
</strong></code></pre>

And simply add methods to it like so:

{% code title="Matrix.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function MatrixLibrary:Offset(pos, x, y, z)
    pos[13] = pos[13] + x
    pos[14] = pos[14] + y
    pos[15] = pos[15] + z
    return pos
end

...
```
{% endcode %}

You can then use the libary methods like so:

{% code title="main.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
local myMatrix = matrix.translation(0, 1, 0)
print(myMatrix) -- 0, 1, 0

local new = MatrixLibrary:Offset(myMatrix, 0, 2, 0)
print(new) -- 0, 3, 0
print(myMatrix) -- 0, 3, 0
```
{% endcode %}

Uh oh! `myMatrix` also got changed from the `:Offset` method. We only want it to provide a new matrix to prevent issues. We could just use `matrix.translation`, but that would get rid of the rotational values. Instead, we can use a built-in library to copy the contents of `pos` (parameter of `:Offset()`) into a new table, and modify that new table instead. We can use a built-in library for this!

{% hint style="info" %}
Matrices in Stormworks are actually tables.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Matrix.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function MatrixLibrary:Offset(pos, x, y, z)
    local new = Noir.Libraries.Table:Copy(pos)
    new[13] = new[13] + x
    new[14] = new[14] + y
    new[15] = new[15] + z

    return new
end
```
{% endcode %}

Problem solved!

## Retrieving A Library

Libraries you create aren't stored in Noir. You have to store them yourselves by either placing them under `Noir.Libraries`, or just by placing them into `_ENV` like so:

```lua
MatrixLibrary = ... -- placed into _ENV
Noir.Libraries.MatrixLibrary = ... -- placed into Noir.Libraries
```

{% hint style="info" %}
\_ENV is a table containing globals.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function hello()
    return "hello world"
end

_ENV["hello"]() -- "hello world"
_ENV.hello() -- "hello world"
hello() -- "hello world"

x = 0
_ENV["x"] -- 0
_ENV.x -- 0
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

## Adding Credit

If you create a library and you would like to credit yourself or others, you can provide extra parameters to `Noir.Libraries:Create()`.

```lua
Noir.Libraries:Create(
    "Name", -- The name of your library
    "Short Description", -- Short description of your library
    "Loooongg description", -- Long description of your library
    {"Cuh4"} -- A table of authors
)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that everything after `"Name"` is optional. See [libraries.md](../api-reference/noir/libraries.md "mention").
{% endhint %}
